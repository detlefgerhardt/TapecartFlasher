TapecartFlasher is a Windows tool to write and read out 
C64 Tapecart modules directly from the PC via an Arduino
UNO or NANO.

At the first use of the Arduino, the Arduino software can
be uploaded from TapecartFlasher to the Ardunio.
Each connection ("Connect") with the Arduino will check if
the Arduino software is up to date.
The Arduino development environment is not needed for this.
The hex files for your Arduino board must exist in same directory
as the TapecartFlasher.exe file.

## Procedure for writing or reading a TCRT file #

1. Connect the Tapecart module to the Arduino via an adapter.

Wiring (Arduino <-> Tapecart):
```
Arduino ! Tapecart
------------------
GND     ! GND
+5V     ! + 5V
Pin D2  ! MOTOR
Pin D3  ! READ
Pin D4  ! WRITE
Pin D5  ! SENSE
```

2. Connect the Arduino via USB to the PC

3. Please check if the Arduino is properly recognized by Windows
and appears as a COM port in Device Manager. You may still need to 
ensure that the correct Arduino USB driver is installed.

4. Start Windows TapecartFlasher tool.

5. Click "Detect". If the Arduino already has a TapecartFlasher
Software, the COM port should by found and displayed.

6. If the Arduino does not yet contain the TapecartFlasher software,
select the correct COM port, click on "Upload / Update Sketch", choose
the correct Arduino board and click Update. The software will now be
transferred to the Arduino. Close the update window and click "Detect" 
again and the correct COM port should be displayed.

7. Click "Connect". After a few seconds, some information about the connected
Tapecart module will be displayed.

8. With the "Write" or "Read" button a TCRT file can be transfered to or from the
Tapecart module.

## New terminal console #

The Arduino software now includes a terminal console that allows you to control
the flasher with any operating system capable of connecting to the Arduino via USB.
In your favorite terminal prorgamm select the USB COM port of the Arduino, set the
baud rate to 115000, switch of local echo and and press Enter.
The TapecardFlasher menu should appear.

```

In the moment it is not possible to transfer TCRT files directly from or to the
PC via the console. But it is  possible to transfer TCRT file from an SD card that
is connected to the Arduino.

Connecting the SD card module to the Arduino (UNO as example):
```
Arduino ! SD card
(UNO)   !
------------------
GND     ! GND
+5V     ! + 5V
Pin 10  ! CS/SS
Pin 11  ! MOSI
Pin 12  ! MISO
Pin 13  ! SCK
```

Please note that some SD card shields have the CS pin hard wired to Pin 4. This
will not work.
