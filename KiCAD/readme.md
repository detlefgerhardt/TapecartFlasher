This is a simple C64 tape adapter I made to connect the Tapecart modul to Arduino.

Here is another adapter: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/esQ330QI

Please note that with these passive adapters the motor line is only driven with 5 volts instead
of 6-7 volts.
This adapter works with my Arduinos and with my Tapecart modules. It is not certain that this 
will work with any combination of Arduino and Tapecart moduls.
