This is a simple C64 tape adapter I made to connect the Tapecart modul to Arduino.

Please note that the motor cable should actually be controlled with at least 6 volts.
This adapter works with my Arduinos and with my Tapecart modules. It is not certain that this 
works with any module combinations.
